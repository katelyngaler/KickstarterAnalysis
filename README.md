# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
This analysis will review Kickstarter data in relation to theater productions focusing on plays in the US and musicals in Great Britain.

Theater is a common kickstarter campaign. Plays have a high success rate. May and June have higher success rates.

Successful US plays have Median Goals of $3000, compared to failed at $5000. The pledged amount for successful is close to the median. But significantly lower for failed ($103).


Great Britain musicals, have a median goal of $2000. However the median pledged amount is only $500. and 25% of campaigns received no funding.

Recommendations:
goal for US is likely too high. May need to look more into why the US ones failed. They didn't receive even close to the goal, or even comparable to the successful goals.

For Great Britian, set goal closer to $2000, but if you can live with $500 you are more likely to get it.
